This project was scoped deliberately to avoid becoming vague or overextended.

In scope

The system supports Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and energy consumption at a site-month level. It includes:

Electricity, natural gas, and fleet fuel activity data

Location-based and market-based Scope 2 logic

Emission factors with versions, effective dates, and sources

Exception tracking for data quality and validation

Certified snapshots for locked reporting periods

The focus is analytical integrity, not real-time monitoring.

Out of scope

To keep the system realistic but manageable, the following are intentionally excluded:

Scope 3 emissions

Financial accounting or cost allocation

Real-time ingestion pipelines

Supplier-level disclosure workflows

These would materially change the system design and are better treated as separate projects.

Primary users

This project is designed for four user groups:

Sustainability and ESG teams
They need confidence in reported numbers, visibility into drivers, and clarity on methodology.

Data and analytics teams
They need a clean model, traceability, and explainable calculations.

Internal audit and risk teams
They need certification rules, change visibility, and exception tracking.

External auditors and consultants
They need documentation, assumptions, and reproducibility.

Every dashboard page and table exists because it answers a real question from one of these users.

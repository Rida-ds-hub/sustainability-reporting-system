This system could be extended in several directions.

Data:

Scope 3 categories and supplier mapping

Renewable certificates and contracts

Financial intensity metrics

Analytics:

Scenario analysis for factor changes

What-if modelling for energy transitions

Automated anomaly detection

Governance:

Role-based approval workflows

Audit trail visualisation

Version comparison between reporting cycles

Platform:

Migration to semantic models

Integration with ESG reporting tools

API-based factor updates

The current design provides a stable foundation for these extensions without rework.

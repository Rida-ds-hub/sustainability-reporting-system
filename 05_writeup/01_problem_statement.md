This project started with a simple but uncomfortable question:

Why is sustainability reporting still treated like a spreadsheet exercise?

Most sustainability dashboards show numbers without explaining where they came from, how reliable they are, or what changed underneath. For external frameworks like GRI and CDP, this is a problem. Reporting is not just about totals; it is about traceability, methodology, certification, and audit readiness.

I built this project to treat sustainability reporting as a data product, not a set of charts.

The goal was to design a system that can:

Explain emissions and energy numbers, not just display them

Surface data quality issues alongside reported values

Make calculation methods and emission factors transparent

Support certification and locked reporting periods

Answer regulator, auditor, and leadership questions from the same system

This project intentionally goes beyond a single dashboard. It includes:

A reporting-grade data model

Clear KPI definitions and governance rules

Multiple analytical views for different stakeholder needs

Explicit assumptions and limitations

The result is a portfolio project that reflects how sustainability analytics works in real organisations, not how it is often simplified in demos.

KPIs are treated as first-class entities, not just labels on measures.

Each KPI is defined by:

KPI ID and name

Unit of measure

Grain (site-month)

Scope (for emissions)

Method flag (LB / MB where applicable)

Definition version and effective date

This allows the system to answer questions like:

Which emission factors were used for this KPI?

Did the calculation method change over time?

Is this KPI eligible for certification?

Certification logic

A reporting period is considered certified when:

All required submissions are received

Validation rules are resolved or accepted

Emission factors are locked

The snapshot is explicitly marked as certified

Certified periods are immutable. Any recalculation requires a new reporting version.

This mirrors real sustainability reporting processes, where numbers cannot silently change after external disclosure.

This project makes several explicit assumptions.

Activity data is complete at a site-month level.
Missing records are treated as gaps, not zeroes.

Emission factors are authoritative for their effective periods.
No retroactive changes are applied to certified data.

Market-based Scope 2 uses residual mix where supplier data is unavailable.

Energy units are normalised before emissions calculation.

Validation exceptions do not automatically block reporting unless flagged as blocking.

Certification applies at a reporting period level, not per KPI.

All time-based analysis uses reporting month boundaries.

The dataset is synthetic and simplified for demonstration.

Limitations:

No Scope 3 modelling

No financial metrics

No real-time recalculation

No automated remediation workflows

These constraints are intentional and documented.

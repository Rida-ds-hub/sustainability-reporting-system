The dashboard is split into four pages, each with a single job.

Summary

Answers:
“How are we doing overall?”

This page shows certified KPIs, high-level trends, and headline exceptions. It avoids analytical detail by design.

Energy & Emissions (Topic View)

Answers:
“Why is this number what it is?”

This is a deep-dive analytical workbench. It includes:

KPI definition and context

Latest value and net change

Change decomposition by site

Energy source breakdown

Emission factors applied

KPI-specific data issues

Nothing on this page is repeated elsewhere.

Data Health

Answers:
“Can I trust this data?”

This page focuses on:

Validation coverage over time

Open exceptions by gate and severity

Exception ageing and backlog

Submission completeness

It is operational and diagnostic, not analytical.

Methods

Answers:
“How is this calculated?”

This page documents:

KPI methodology

Emission factor sets and versions

Certification and locking rules

Assumptions and exclusions

Data ownership and responsibility

It is designed to be read slowly, not interacted with heavily.
